# CaseStudy2DDS
---

This repository is designed for a case study focused on predicting wine quality. This project includes exploratory data exploration, visualizations, and a linear regression model.

## Project Overview

In the first phase of this project, we conducted an initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset, **Wine Train Set.csv**. This dataset provides a foundation for understanding the factors that may influence wine qulaity. We build the linear regression model to reduce Mean Absolute Error (MAE). 

Following the initial presentation, we leveraged a secondary dataset, **Wine Test Set.csv**, to build a linear regression model. This model aims to identify wine quality.

## Project Goal

Our primary objective is to create a reliable model to predict wine qulaity. By analyzing different patterns, we aim to highlight the most significant factors contributing to wine qulaity.

## Key Wine Quality Factors

Based on our analysis, the following factors have been identified as the most influential in wine qulaity:

| #  | Factor                                        |
|----|-----------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Alcohol                                       |
| 2  | Citric Acid                                   |
| 3  | Density                                       |
| 4  | Fixed Acidity                                 |
| 5  | Free Sulfur Dioxide                           |
| 6  | pH                                            |
| 7  | Residual Sugar                                |
| 8  | Sulphates                                     |
| 9  | Total Sulfur Dioxide                          |
| 10 | Volatile Acidity                              |
